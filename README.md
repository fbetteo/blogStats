To upload a flexdashboard:
https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/09/06/adding-r-markdown-documents-of-other-output-formats/
Put the RMD in static and serve site (having put build.R in /R)
This will generate the html but I don't know how to add that as a post.
So, generate a post as usual and include the link to this html in there.
Ex: https://github.com/fbetteo/blogStats/blob/master/content/post/2020-10-06-non-negative-matrix-factorization.en-us.Rmd
